        A Board of Directors plays a vital role in the governance and strategic direction of
        any institution, including a high school. As stewards of the school's mission and
        vision, the
        <strong>Board of Directors at Bishop Foley Catholic</strong> acts as a collective
        body responsible for making important decisions and providing guidance on matters
        ranging from educational
        policies and financial management to long-term planning and community engagement.
        Comprising individuals with diverse expertise and backgrounds, the Board brings
        their collective wisdom to
        ensure the school's continued growth, excellence, and commitment to serving its
        students, faculty, staff, and the wider community.
